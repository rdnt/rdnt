Hi!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm glad you are here. :octocat:

My name is Tasos, and I am a software engineer based in Thessaloniki, Greece.  
I love designing and programming, tinkering with both software and hardware, as well as gaming from time to time.  
I mostly use GitHub while iterating on side-projects.

Open source projects I've been recently working on:
- [**rdnt/m8**](https://github.com/rdnt/m8) - Pixelated retro watch face for WearOS
- [**rdnt/ledctl**](https://github.com/rdnt/ledctl3poc) - Wireless lighting control system ([currently being refactored!](https://github.com/rdnt/ledctl3poc))
- [**rdnt/tachyon**](https://github.com/rdnt/tachyon) - Multiplayer terminal drawing app with CQRS/ES
- [**rdnt/tinyht**](https://github.com/rdnt/tinyht) - Head tracker for OpenTrack written in TinyGo 
- [**rdnt/myst**](https://github.com/rdnt/myst) - Zero-knowledge, end-to-end encrypted password manager

Current favorite track: [goddard. - Nicotine](https://open.spotify.com/track/4K215Fh7PF53yfeSPGtq2L?si=21d1ac6d5a4e4f6a)
