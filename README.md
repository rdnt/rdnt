### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! :octocat:

My name is Tasos, and I am a working student and software engineer from Greece. I love programming, designing, gaming or tinkering with programs in varied, interesting ways. I mostly use GitHub while iterating on my personal projects and sometimes for work-related stuff~

Check out what I've been recently working on:
- [**tachyon**](https://github.com/rdnt/tachyon) - Multiplayer terminal drawing app with CQRS/ES
- [**m8**](https://github.com/rdnt/m8) - A retro, pixelated watch face for WearOS
- [**ledctl**](https://github.com/rdnt/ledctl) - A wireless ambient lighting controller ([currently being refactored!](https://github.com/rdnt/ledctl3poc))
