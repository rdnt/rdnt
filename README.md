### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tasos, a software engineer based in Greece. I enjoy programming, designing stuff, playing computer games, and everything in-between.  

Check out what I've been recently working on:
- [**ledctl**](https://github.com/rdnt/ledctl) - Wireless Ambient lighting controller written in Go
- [**m8face**](https://github.com/rdnt/m8face) - A retro, pixelated watch face for WearOS
- [**myst**](https://github.com/rdnt/myst) - Zero-knowledge, end-to-end encrypted password manager (coming soonâ„¢!)
