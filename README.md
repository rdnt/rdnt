Hi :D

![coffee](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17600197/179931868-770dfafe-8d43-4975-b739-cda5ffa76c4b.gif)

I write code. A lot of it. Maybe too much.

Some open-source projects I am currently working on:
- [**ledctl**](https://github.com/rdnt/ledctl) - A controller written in Go that allows commanding a Raspberry Pi to change colors of an LED strip
- [**benchkram/bob**](https://github.com/benchkram/bob) - A polyglot build tool with ease-of-use, performance and reproducibility in mind


If you like my projects, you can show your support by buying me a coffee ðŸ’–
