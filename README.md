Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I like writing code. A lot of it. Maybe too much.

Some projects I've been recently working on:
- [**ledctl**](https://github.com/rdnt/ledctl) - A wireless LED controller written in Go
- [**myst**](https://github.com/rdnt/myst) - Zero-knowledge, end-to-end encrypted password manager
- [**benchkram/bob**](https://github.com/benchkram/bob) - A build system for microservices

If you like my work here, consider buying me a coffee 💖
