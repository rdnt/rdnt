Hi :D

I write code. A lot of it. Maybe too much.

Some open-source projects I am currently working on:
- [**ledctl**](https://github.com/rdnt/ledctl) - A controller written in Go that allows commanding a Raspberry Pi to change colors of an LED strip
- [**benchkram/bob**](https://github.com/benchkram/bob) - A polyglot build tool with ease-of-use, performance and reproducibility in mind

If you enjoy my projects here, you can show your support by buying me a coffee ðŸ’–
