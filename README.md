### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tasos, a software engineer based in Thessaloniki, Greece. I enjoy programming, hacking, playing computer games and everything in-between.  

Check out what I've been recently working on:
- [**ledctl**](https://github.com/rdnt/ledctl) - An ambilight socket-based controller written in Go
<!-- - [**myst**](https://github.com/rdnt/myst) - Zero-knowledge, end-to-end encrypted password manager (coming soonâ„¢!)
 -->

If you like my work, consider buying me a coffee ðŸ’–
