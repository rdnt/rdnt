### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! :octocat:

My name is Tasos, and I am a working student and software engineer based in Greece. I love programming, designing, gaming or tinkering with programs in varried, interesting ways. I mostly use GitHub to host my personal projects, but also for work-related stuff on occasion~

Check out what I've been recently working on:
- [**ledctl**](https://github.com/rdnt/ledctl) - Wireless Ambient lighting controller written in Go
- [**m8**](https://github.com/rdnt/m8) - A retro, pixelated watch face for WearOS
<!-- - [**myst**](https://github.com/rdnt/myst) - Zero-knowledge, end-to-end encrypted password manager (coming soonâ„¢!) -->
